What do you think about "Mathematical Statistics" these days? I've been studying and actually "playing" with my GPT models and Claude and so on,
and I became to wonder the question.

As a data scientist -- at least I try to be a nice one -- with 5 years experience, I could not find the answer yet, but it's definitely critical base of data analysis skill.

So I would like to have a quick recap for the data scientist who are living this crazy era.
